                As a highly skilled software engineer, I have a wealth of
                experience blending GIS domain knowledge with software
                development to create stunning and efficient geospatial
                applications. My academic background includes a bachelor's
                degree in GIS and Remote Sensing from U.C.S.B., where I had the
                privilege of studying under renowned thought leaders Michael
                Goodchild and Waldo Tobler. I further honed my skills with an
                M.S. in Geoinformatics and Geospatial Intelligence at George
                Mason University. After graduation, I played a pivotal role in
                launching one of the world's most viewed geospatial web
                applications, <a

                After Esri, I spent a year as an Integration Consultant at a
                business intelligence startup called YellowfinBI, which was
                acquired by Idera Inc. in 2022. I left Yellowfin after the
                acquisition to work on this blog while also raising my son,
                Justice Solly was born on 2/20/22. Six months later, I joined
                University of Maryland as a Senior Geospatial Developer for the <a

                efficient, accessible, and sustainable onloading, analysis, and
                extraction of large geospatial datasets into blockchain-managed
                decentralized storage systems such as Filecoin and IPFS. During
                my time there, I authored a comprehensive <a

                and most influential contracts. One of my major projects was a web-based

                This project, built with Vue.js and TypeScript and deployed on AWS
                using Terraform, transformed complex Excel data into an interactive
                web platform. I implemented dynamic model output functionality and
                added administrative CRUD operations using AWS Cognito, significantly
                enhancing user interaction and data visualization capabilities.
