                I've launched products used by millions and rooted out waste at
                federal agencies. From startups to Fortune 500s, research labs
                to DOGE—I've seen how software gets built in every kind of
                organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have degrees in Geospatial Information Science and Geospatial
                Intelligence, but the real education has been shipping code as
                an IC, product owner, and consultant. Software development is a
                game, and I'm obsessed with playing it well. For the past
                decade, I deliberately turned down management tracks to stay
                technical. As Elon Musk says, "A cavalry captain should know how
                to ride a horse."
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I'm a Division CTO at Leidos, leading digital
                modernization for federal health and benefits agencies. I advise
                on software architecture, evaluating technical partners, and
                finding the right solutions for our customers.
            </p>

                Outside work, you can find me at a CrossFit gym, on a running
                trail, and in the kitchen cooking for my wife, Holiday, and son,
                Justice. There's usually an app I'm tinkering on, too.
