                >—I've seen how software gets built in every kind of
                organization. I have degrees in Geospatial Information Science
                and Geospatial Intelligence, but the real education has been
                shipping code as an IC, product owner, and consultant.

                Software development is a game, and I'm obsessed with playing it
                well. Clean architecture, ruthless simplification, shipping code
                that actually works. For the past decade, I deliberately turned
                down management tracks to stay technical. As Elon Musk says, "a
                cavalry captain should know how to ride a horse."

                Today, I'm a Division CTO at Leidos, leading digital
                modernization for federal health and benefits agencies—Social
                Security, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services. Most of my time
                goes to advising on architecture, evaluating partners, and
                finding the right technical solutions for our customers.

                Outside of work, it's CrossFit, trail running, and cooking for
                my wife Holiday and son Justice. There's usually an app I'm
                tinkering on too.
